# AnalyticsDay2023
This repository contains datasets and Stata do-file to reproduce my analysis presented in Analytics Data Spring 2023 in Kennesaw State University.
To reproduce results, just put the do-file and everything else in one directory, set the path in do-file and run it.
The macroeconomic indicators are pulled from FRED database, the exact type of macro-data can easily be recovered by its ticker.
The bank specific data comes form FFIEC Central Data Repository's Public Data Distribution repository.
More details later after I am done with CSBS competition.
